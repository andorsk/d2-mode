# d2-mode

A [d2](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2) extension for Emacs. This was heavily
inspired of [Mermaid Mode](https://github.com/abrochard/mermaid-mode).

**Status:** Alpha. Available on Melpa. 

It works you can use this to render d2 in both your browser and in an emacs buffer. See [Bugs & Issues](#bugs--issues) for known issues.

## Why D2

Text to graph diagrams are awesome. I used Mermaid.js all the time and it was
fantastic, but there were a few things it couldn't do so I wanted to expand my
options.

Some things that I've noticed d2 has some interesting support in:

1. More themes
2. Code Blocks
3. More visual customization
4. More graph support
5. Autoformat

Learn more about [d2 here](https://d2lang.com/tour/intro/)

## Installation

1. Load the d2-mode.el file or install from melpa: `M-x package-install d2-mode`
2. Install d2 binary from the d2 project if you plan to compile graphs in Emacs

## Usage

```text
C-c C-c - compile current file to an image
C-c C-f - compile given file to an image
C-c C-b - compile current buffer to an image
C-c C-r - compile current region to an image
C-c C-o - open in the live editor
C-c C-d - open the official doc
```

Note: All compile commands will open the output in a buffer to view the resulting image.

## Customization

### `d2fmt` on Save

Add this to your `init.el` file to auto fmt on save

```elisp
(add-hook 'before-save-hook #d2fmt-before-save)
```

### `d2` binary location

You can specify the location of `d2` with the variable `d2-location`, the default assumes you have the binary in your `PATH` (and for that you probably want/need to install [`d2`](https://github.com/andorsk/d2-mode)).

### Output format

You can specify png or svg output format by putting this in your `init.el` file:

```(setq d2-output-format "<OUTPUT_FORMAT")```

Options are: 
- `.png`
- `.svg`

Default is SVG.

### Temp directory

By default `d2-tmp-dir` points to `\tmp\`. Feel free to set it to a more appropriate location that works for you (e.g. on windows).

### Key bindings

To customize the key bindings put this into your `init.el` ...

```elisp
(defvar d2-mode-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'd2-compile)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-f") 'd2-compile-file)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-b") 'd2-compile-buffer)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-r") 'd2-compile-region)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-h") 'd2-compile-file-and-browse)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-j") 'd2-compile-buffer-and-browse)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-k") 'd2-compile-region-and-browse)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-o") 'd2-open-browser)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-x C-o") 'd2-view-current-svg)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-d") 'd2-open-doc)
    map))

```

### Bonus

See the `snippets` folder for yas snippets. Start making d2 graphs today!

### Roadmap

- Even better syntax highlighting and formatting
- Watch mode support

## Bugs & Issues

- SVG's have issues rending in emacs sometimes. See
  [#13](https://github.com/andorsk/d2-mode/issues/13) and
  [#8](https://github.com/andorsk/d2-mode/issues/8) for more details. You can use the
  `*browse` commands to render it directly in your browser instead!

Feel free to open an issue and or contribute to this repo over a PR!
